 * @discription - A software system for an estate agent selling houses.
 * A class whose instances can store some basic details 
 * about a house: its address and asking price. The
 * class will need a field to store an amount of money 
 * (a whole number of pounds) for the price and a field 
 * (a String) for the address. There will also be methods
 * that allow the price to be altered.
