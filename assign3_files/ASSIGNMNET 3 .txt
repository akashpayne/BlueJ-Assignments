object bench by right clicking over the Helper class and selecting Test Fixture to
Object Bench. Do that and then call the TaxiCo’s showStatus method to print a list
of the statuses of the three vehicles. You can find out more about the unit testing
features in chapter 7 of the course textbook and one of the appendices.
